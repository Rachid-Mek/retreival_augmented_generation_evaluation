              " 'Turn back time, more than 90 years, to a cold case that won\\'t gather dust. It\\'s a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor\\'s political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country\\'s highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press. At the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who\\'d moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia. Considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian. In the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums. Who murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care? Answers to these questions, or theories, keep coming. \"Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,\" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, \"The People v. Leo Frank,\" will air Monday on PBS. \"The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable.\" Mixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways. The accused \"The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,\" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank.

After this they started bombing train tracks and doing more overt military resistance to the British occupation, as it was known then.

Another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer. \"He\\'s being painted as an ogre, which doesn\\'t fit,\" said the former. Two faculty members said Zinkhan was introverted but friendly. He was close to some colleagues. He remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at Christmas. His quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance, a colleague said. One fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius, and not just with marketing, either. Zinkhan apparently was well-versed in a wide range of topics -- art, opera, architecture -- and he loved sports. Faculty members recalled that the strapping 6-foot-2 Zinkhan played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students, and he liked to boast of his home runs. He also loved his son, 8, and daughter, 10, and regularly brought them to work.

People like Megan Sims. \"Of course it\\'s a dream job,\" she said. \"You get to play with LEGOs and kids all day.

The Atlanta contestants were narrowed down on the first day by several rounds of tasks, or builds. In the first, competitors built an animal in 45 minutes. This gave birth to lions, ducks, fish and alligators. There were even some angry birds. Build two was a little more complex; the contestants were charged with building an Atlanta icon. Entries included Ray Charles singing, the immensely popular Peachtree road race and the Fox Theatre, a well-known Midtown entertainment venue. Twelve contestants were selected for the finals, in which they created a model that best described them. They had one hour.

Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner He Kexin was only 14 years old. The federation said it has concluded its inquiry into the matter after it confirmed the gymnasts\\' ages through official documents that the Chinese Gymnasts Association provided. The documents included passports, identity cards and household registers. However, the organization intends to further investigate the ages of two gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun, who participated in the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia. The federation said it did not consider the explanations and evidence that Chinese authorities provided in regard to those athletes as satisfactory.

One of the challenges came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claimed to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14. In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China\\'s General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He.

They include an archer, a weightlifter, a judoka, two rowers and two sprinters, one of whom is Dana Hussain.
