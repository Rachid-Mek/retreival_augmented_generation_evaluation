A year later, he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. At a chaotic press conference at New York\\'s 21 Club, the Cosmos unveiled Pelé. John O\\'Reilly, the club\\'s media spokesman, stated, \"We had superstars in the United States but nothing at the level of Pelé. Everyone wanted to touch him, shake his hand, get a photo with him.\" Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the US. During his first public appearance in Boston, he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It\\'s a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor\\'s political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country\\'s highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press. At the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who\\'d moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia. Considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian. In the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums. Who murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care? Answers to these questions, or theories, keep coming. \"Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,\" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, \"The People v. Leo Frank,\" will air Monday on PBS. \"The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable.\" Mixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways.

Speaker was originally found to have an extremely drug resistant strain (XDR-TB) of the respiratory disease earlier this year, but on July 3 doctors said he had multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which is treatable with less toxic drugs. Speaker and his fiancee had gone to Europe on May 12 for their wedding in Greece, despite warnings from the Fulton County Health Department in Georgia that he should not fly because he risked infecting fellow passengers. Since then, eight people who shared a flight with Speaker have filed a lawsuit against him, seeking $1.3 million in damages. Rosalind Yee -- an attorney for the plaintiffs who said her clients include a ninth person related to one of the passengers but who was not on the flight -- said all eight passengers have undergone TB tests since they returned home. One of them, a 72-year-old man, tested positive for TB on a skin test, though it was not clear that Speaker was the source. The man\\'s X-rays were normal, she said, and he is awaiting results of further tests. In the past year, there have been about 124 cases of MDR-TB in the United States. About half of those patients have elected to undergo the surgery to remove the diseased portion of',\n",

Yet the government said it is simply acting in response to parental complaints about the negative affects of the Internet on children. Responding to reporters\\' questions, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang acknowledges the controversy over the software in and outside China. \"However,\" he said in a regular press conference last week, \"no matter how many different views there are, the Chinese government assumes the responsibility to protect our youth from unhealthy information on the Internet, and so do various social circles and enterprises. This is the essence of this problem.\" The government said it is simply providing the software free of charge, as a',\n",
              " 'BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee has asked gymnastics officials to look into whether China\\'s women\\'s gymnastics team used underaged competitors, an IOC spokeswoman said Friday. China\\'s He Kexin kisses her gold medal last week after winning the Olympic women\\'s uneven bars. The committee asked the International Gymnastics Federation to clarify the situation, said spokeswoman Giselle Davis. She said she wouldn\\'t call it a formal investigation. The Chinese women\\'s gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Summer Olympics Games. Five members won medals in individual competitions. Yet commentators, bloggers and others have raised questions about whether about half the members of China\\'s team were old enough to compete -- athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place. In women\\'s gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames. \"We have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case,\" Davis said. A top Chinese Olympic official said questions regarding the ages of the athletes have been dealt with previously. \"The eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and, if they hadn\\'t been cleared, they wouldn\\'t have participated in the games,\" said Wang Wei, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic Committee. Chinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made. The latest came from a blogger known as \"Stryde Hax.\" The blogger claims to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14. Watch bloggers question China\\'s gymnasts » In Internet searches, \"Stryde Hax\" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China\\'s General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He. That would make her 14 -- too young to compete in the Olympic Games. CNN has not been able to independently verify the information, but snapshots of the Web pages appear to back up the claim. Other bloggers have joined the search and reported similar results. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team. The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1, 1994. ',\n",
              " 'Watch a historian discuss the Olympics in Iraq under Saddam Hussein Â» She said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated. The deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month. The Games begin August 8. A former official from the disbanded Iraq Olympic Committee said the IOC\\'s decision was justified because the government interfered with the national committee by suspending it. The former official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. He said he believed that the government suspended the committee out of \"jealousy.\" The national committee was making great strides, and the government, namely the Ministry of Youth and Sports, wanted control of it, he said. The seven Iraqi athletes who were to travel to China for the Games\\' start in August are disappointed by the decision, officials said. They include an archer, a weightlifter, a judoka, two rowers and two sprinters, one of whom is Dana Hussain. Her coach called the decision unfair and said he blames \"everyone\": the Iraqi government and the Iraqi and International Olympic committees. In the end, Abdul Rahman said, the athletes are paying the price. \"It\\'s a shame after all the efforts, ambitions, risks and dangers,\" he said. \"I wish from the bottom of my heart they would reconsider this unjust decision for the sake of the athletes.\" CNN\\'s Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.']"
